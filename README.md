# Traffic-Light-System-Using-ARM-7
This project demonstrates a traffic light control system using the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. The system controls red, yellow, and green LEDs to simulate a traffic signal with predefined time delays. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
# Features
Simulates a standard traffic light cycle with red, yellow, and green LEDs.
Uses timers and delays for accurate light transitions.
Can be modified to include pedestrian signals or sensor-based control.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: LPC2148 (ARM7),
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Keil uVision,
Simulation Software: Proteus.
# How It Works
The red, yellow, and green LEDs are connected to the LPC2148 microcontroller.
The microcontroller turns the LEDs on and off based on predefined timing sequences.
The system continuously cycles through the traffic light sequence.
