# Traffic-Light-System-Using-ARM-7
This project demonstrates a traffic light control system using the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. The system controls red, yellow, and green LEDs to simulate a traffic signal with predefined time delays. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
